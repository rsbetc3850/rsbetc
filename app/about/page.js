            LMYNL is the creation of Travis &apos;Oz&apos; and his chiweenie Tupac. Travis had extensive IT experience in a variety of roles at various Fortune 500 companies before striking out on his own in 2017.

Whether it was figuring out how to open the treat jar or navigating the dog park with ease, Tupac always seemed to be one step ahead of the game.
